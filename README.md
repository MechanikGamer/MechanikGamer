Hello there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm MechanikGamer, a passionate self-taught web developer and a lifelong learner of coding crafts. I thrive on challenge and constant improvement, pushing the boundaries of what I know by diving into new technologies and coding paradigms.

ðŸŒ± I've progressed significantly in my learning journey...  
Having mastered the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” the core components of web development, I've successfully delved deep into the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: My go-to NoSQL database for robust data management.
- **Express**: For developing powerful APIs.
- **React**: Utilized in crafting dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Employed for scalable server-side scripting.

I've taken my skills further by developing a cross-platform application using React Native with the Expo framework. This app, which is currently 75% complete and built on a solid backend of MongoDB and Node.js with Express, showcases my ability to create versatile mobile solutions.

ðŸ”§ I've also started learning TypeScript to leverage its robust features for more reliable and error-free coding. I try to use TypeScript wherever possible to fully harness its advantages.

In addition to my development skills, I have a strong proficiency in Linux server administration, with a particular focus on AWS Cloud. My expertise also extends to Next.js, MERN, and React. Currently, I am working on enhancing my corporate programming skills through practical experiences in a professional setting.

Looking forward to continuing my journey in tech, constantly evolving and refining my skills!
