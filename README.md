ðŸ‘‹ **Hello, I'm MechanikGamer** â€” a passionate web developer, lifelong learner, and coding enthusiast, always seeking to push the boundaries of what I know by embracing new technologies and challenging myself with complex projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve come a long way in my journey, having mastered the essentials of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” the cornerstones of modern web development. Diving deeper, Iâ€™ve built expertise in the **MERN stack**, using:

- **MongoDB**: My NoSQL database of choice for efficient data management.
- **Express**: Crafting powerful and scalable APIs.
- **React**: Building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Delivering high-performance, server-side solutions.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on a cross-platform mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo**. This app is almost ready to hit the **App Store** and **Google Play**, with just some design refinements and final testing left. I've been using **Sentry** to monitor and manage errors, ensuring a smooth user experience. After thorough testing with friends, the app will soon be live for the world to explore!

ðŸ”§ To further refine my skills, Iâ€™ve incorporated **TypeScript** into my workflow, harnessing its robust type system to write more reliable, maintainable code. I now use TypeScript wherever possible to reduce bugs and increase code quality.

ðŸš€ **Next on my journey** is tackling larger, more ambitious projects. My goal is to independently build a full-stack application and a React Native app that showcases my advanced skills, implementing best coding practices and techniques. With over 600+ hours tracked on **WakaTime**, Iâ€™m confident in my ability to tackle complex problems and deliver high-quality solutions.

ðŸ’» Additionally, Iâ€™m proud to contribute to **Open Source projects** whenever time allows. Iâ€™ve helped resolve bugs and enhance functionality in various projects, leveraging my skills to give back to the community.
