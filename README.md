# Hello there! 👋

I'm MechanikGamer, a passionate self-taught web developer and a lifelong learner of coding crafts. I thrive on challenge and constant improvement, pushing the boundaries of what I know by diving into new technologies and coding paradigms.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning...

My journey has taken me through the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the building blocks of the web. Now, I've set my sights on mastering the MERN stack:

- **React** to create dynamic user interfaces
- **Node.js** for scalable server-side scripting
- **MongoDB** as my go-to NoSQL database
- **Express** for robust API development

In addition to these, I'm diving into mobile development with **React Native**. I'm eager to apply my React skills to build cross-platform mobile applications and expand my development capabilities.

And once I've got these down, I plan to expand my toolbox by adding **TypeScript** to the mix for more robust and error-free code.

## 💼 Experience

Beyond the code, I have some hands-on experience with **Linux server management** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, which has given me a solid understanding of the cloud infrastructure and deployment strategies. While I've had fun setting up websites on **WordPress**, I'm excited to move on to larger and more complex projects.
